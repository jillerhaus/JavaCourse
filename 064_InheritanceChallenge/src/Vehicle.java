        // Finally create another class, a specific type of Car that inherits from the Car class
        // You should be able to handle steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other words)
        // You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviors (fields and methods)
        // As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included.
        // For your specific type of vehicle you will want to add something unique
